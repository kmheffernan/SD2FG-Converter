					<p>Your soul willingly leaves your body and occupies a target in near range. An unwilling target can make a CHA check vs. your spellcasting check. If they fail, you control the target on your turn, but your body stands in a helpless daze.</p>
					<p>When the target returns to its body, it becomes aware of the possession, but retains no memories of what transpired.</p>
					<p>If the target dies, you return to your body as long as it is within near range, otherwise you return to your body and drop to 0 HP.</p>
