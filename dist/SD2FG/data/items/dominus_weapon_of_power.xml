				<p><i>Initially appears as a pure black sword.</i></p>
				<p><b>Bonus</b> Magical +2 weapon</p>
				<p><b>Benefit</b> When you first touch this item, it instantly morphs into your most-used melee weapon, appearing as an inky void in time and space.</p>
				<p><b>Benefit</b> You can see lawful beings with a halo of light around them -- even in total darkness.</p>
				<p><b>Curse</b> From darkness, if you do not attack lawful beings, you take 1d4 HP of damage for every round you remain in darkness.</p>
				<p><b>Curse</b> If you drop this weapon, you lose half of your hit points every round until you reach 1, at which point you cannot be healed until you regain possession of the weapon, or until someone else picks it up, at which point you are cleared of your curse and can be healed as normal.</p>
				<p><i>Dominus suggests that you convert your allies to chaotic followers of his divine self, effectively ridding yourself of the need to kill them!</i></p>
