					<p>Cannot swim; Disadvantage on stealth checks.</p>
				<p><i>Deep blue plate mail traced with gold lightning motifs and red gems arrayed into the shape of flames.</i></p>
				<p><b>Bonus.</b> +1 plate mail. Can only be worn by a chaotic being. If you also wield Memnon's Discordant Blade and Memnon's Blazing Javelin, it becomes +3 plate mail.</p>
				<p><b>Benefit.</b> Once per day, you can speak the armor's command word. Until your next turn, all non-magical weapons that strike you are instantly unmade, shattering into dust. You take no damage from them.</p>
