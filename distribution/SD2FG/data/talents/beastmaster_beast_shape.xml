					<p>Once per day, you and your possessions may transform into the natural form of your chosen beast for 3 rounds, taking on the animalâ€™s statistics, attacks, and abilities. You still need light to see. If you take damage while in this form, do not transfer that damage to your own HP when you return to your humanoid form. If you reach 0 HP in your animal form, you transform back at 0 HP, starting your death timer as normal.</p>
