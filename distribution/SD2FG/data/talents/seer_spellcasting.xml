					<p>You can cast seer spells you know. You know one tier 1 spell of your choice from the seer spell list. Each time you gain a level, you choose a new seer spell to learn according to the Seer Spells Known table. You use your Wisdom stat to cast seer spells. The DC is 10 + the spell's tier. If you fail a spellcasting check, you can't cast that spell again until you complete a rest. If you roll a natural 1 on a spellcasting check, you can't cast that spell again until you complete Seer Penance.</p>
