					<p>You magically beguile one humanoid of LV 2 or less within near range who is compelled to approach one of your undead minions and allow itself to be attacked with advantage.</p>
					<p>If there are no undead minions, the affected humanoid follows you to the best of its ability until the spell ends or an undead minion appears.</p>
					<p>If a minion kills it, that undead is healed to full HP. The spell ends if you or your allies hurt it, but stays beguiled if a minion attacks it. The target remembers you magically enchanted it.</p>
