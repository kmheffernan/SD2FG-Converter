				<p><i>A bone-carved ring with a ram skull. Its horns twist forward and red lights glow in its eye sockets.</i></p>
				<p><b>Benefit.</b> Once per day, you can enter a rage where you deal double damage for 5 rounds. During the rage, you can't cast spells and enemies have advantage on melee attacks against you.</p>
				<p><b>Personality.</b> Chaotic. Aggressive, overconfident. Seeks to provoke you and your enemies into battle.</p>
