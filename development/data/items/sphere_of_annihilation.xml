					<p><i>A three-foot, spherical void of pure darkness that hovers above the ground.</i></p>
					<p><b>Benefit.</b> This sphere utterly destroys all matter it touches.</p>
					<p><b>Benefit.</b> Intelligent beings can move the flying sphere a near distance by passing a DC 18 Intelligence check. If multiple creatures vie for control of the sphere, it is a contested Intelligence check instead. Wizards have advantage on this check. The winner moves the sphere a near distance. If the sphere moves into a space occupied by a creature, the being controlling the sphere makes an attack roll against that creature with a +7 bonus. On a hit, the creature is obliterated.</p>
