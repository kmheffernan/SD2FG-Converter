				<p><i>An inconspicuous tattered cloak with a torn hood.</i></p>
				<p><b>Benefit</b> When you pull the hood over your head, you and your equipment become incorporeal. You can move through solid objects and cannot attack with or be struck by physical weapons. You may cast spells and hostile spells can affect you.</p>
				<p><b>Curse</b> For every round you are incorporeal, roll 1d6. On the result of a 1, a specter sees you from the spirit world, comes to your plane of existence, and attacks you. </p>
